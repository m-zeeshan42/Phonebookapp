# Image Classification Model Using VGG16 and Fine-Tuning

This repository contains an image classification model using the pre-trained **VGG16** architecture, fine-tuned for five classes: **['berry', 'bird', 'dog', 'flower', 'other']**. The model achieves approximately **95.6% accuracy** on the test dataset. It is built using **TensorFlow** and **Keras** and provides functionality for predicting single or multiple images.

## Features

- **VGG16 Base Model**: A widely-used pre-trained model for image classification.
- **Fine-tuning**: Unfreezing the VGG16 model layers after initial training for better performance.
- **Data Augmentation**: Random transformations (rotation, shift, shear, zoom, flip) applied to training images to generalize the model better.
- **Callbacks**: Includes early stopping, learning rate reduction, and model checkpointing.
- **Single and Batch Prediction**: Python scripts for predicting a single image or an entire folder of images.

## Installation

To use this model, clone the repository and install the required dependencies.

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/image-classification-vgg16.git
cd image-classification-vgg16
```

### 2. Install the dependencies

Use the provided `requirements.txt` to install the necessary Python packages.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The key dependencies include:

- `tensorflow`: For model creation and training.
- `numpy`: For numerical operations.
- `Pillow`: For image preprocessing.

### 3. Train the model (optional)

To train the model on your custom dataset, ensure your dataset is structured as:

```
dataset/
    train/
        class1/
        class2/
        ...
    test/
        class1/
        class2/
        ...
```

Then run the training script:

```bash
python train_model.py
```

This will train the model using the **VGG16** architecture and save the best model based on validation loss. The model is trained with early stopping, learning rate reduction, and checkpointing.

### 4. Use the pre-trained model

If you want to use the pre-trained model to make predictions, you can either predict a **single image** or a **batch of images** from a directory.

---

## How to Use

### Predict Single Image

To predict a single image, use the provided `predict_single_image.py` script. Here's an example command:

```bash
python predict_single_image.py --img_path path/to/your/image.jpg
```

Replace `path/to/your/image.jpg` with the path to the image you want to predict. The script will load the model and output the predicted class and the probabilities for each class.

Example output:

```
Predicted Class: dog
Prediction Probabilities: [0.01, 0.02, 0.95, 0.01, 0.01]
```

### Predict Multiple Images

You can also predict all images in a folder by using the `predict_multiple_images.py` script:

```bash
python predict_multiple_images.py --folder_path path/to/your/image_folder
```

This will predict and output the class and probabilities for each image in the specified folder.

Example output:

```
Image: image1.jpg -> Predicted Class: flower
Prediction Probabilities: [0.02, 0.01, 0.01, 0.95, 0.01]

Image: image2.jpg -> Predicted Class: dog
Prediction Probabilities: [0.01, 0.03, 0.90, 0.02, 0.04]
```

## Model Architecture

The model is built by adding custom layers to the pre-trained **VGG16** model. Below is the architecture:

1. **VGG16 Base Model**: Loaded with weights pre-trained on ImageNet.
2. **Flatten Layer**: To convert 2D feature maps to 1D feature vectors.
3. **Dense Layer (512 units)**: Fully connected layer with ReLU activation and L2 regularization.
4. **Dropout Layer (50%)**: To prevent overfitting by randomly dropping connections during training.
5. **Dense Layer (5 units)**: Output layer with softmax activation for multi-class classification.

The model is trained using **Adam optimizer** with a learning rate of `0.0001` initially, and fine-tuning is done by unfreezing the VGG16 layers and reducing the learning rate to `1e-5` for further training.

---

## Callbacks and Training Strategy

- **Early Stopping**: Stops training when the validation loss stops improving to avoid overfitting.
- **Learning Rate Scheduler**: Reduces the learning rate by a factor of 0.5 if the validation loss plateaus for 3 epochs.
- **Model Checkpoint**: Saves the best model during training based on validation loss, ensuring you keep the most effective version.

---

## Example Workflow

### 1. Model Training

You can start by training the model from scratch, or fine-tune the pre-trained model. Use the following command to train:

```bash
python train_model.py
```

This script handles data augmentation, compiling the model, setting up callbacks, and training. By default, it will train for 20 epochs and fine-tune for an additional 10 epochs.

### 2. Evaluation

Once training is complete, you can evaluate the model on the test set:

```python
test_loss, test_acc = model.evaluate(test_generator)
print(f"Test Accuracy: {test_acc * 100:.2f}%")
```

### 3. Prediction

For prediction, you can either pass a single image or a directory of images:

- **Single image prediction**:

```bash
python predict_single_image.py --img_path 'path/to/image.jpg'
```

- **Multiple image prediction**:

```bash
python predict_multiple_images.py --folder_path 'path/to/image_folder'
```

---

## Dataset

The model was trained on a custom dataset consisting of 5 classes:

1. **berry**
2. **bird**
3. **dog**
4. **flower**
5. **other**

Images should be organized into respective class folders within `train/` and `test/` directories. During training, data augmentation is applied to the training set to improve generalization.

---

## Fine-Tuning

To further improve model performance, the VGG16 base model's layers are unfrozen after the initial training, and the entire model is fine-tuned with a lower learning rate (`1e-5`). This allows the pre-trained weights to be slightly adjusted based on the new dataset, which can improve accuracy on domain-specific tasks.

---

## Requirements

To install the dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Hereâ€™s the list of dependencies:

- **TensorFlow**: Core machine learning library.
- **NumPy**: For array operations.
- **Pillow**: For image preprocessing.

### requirements.txt

```txt
tensorflow
numpy
Pillow
```

## Results

After training the model, it achieves approximately **95.6% accuracy** on the test dataset. The following is a sample prediction result for a single image:

```
Image: a.jpg
Predicted Class: dog
Prediction Probabilities: [0.01, 0.02, 0.95, 0.01, 0.01]
```
